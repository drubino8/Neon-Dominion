        </ul>
    </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Roles determine the turn order and starting advantages.</li>
            <li>For the first round, assign roles randomly:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legend</strong> – The most powerful position; this player takes the first turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixer</strong> – The second in power, playing after the Legend.</li>
                <li><strong>Mercenary</strong> – The third player in line, adaptable but unpredictable.</li>

                <li>(For 5 or 6 players) Additional players take turns after the Street Rat.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Assign roles for later rounds
        <ul>
            <li>After the first round, roles are determined based on the order in which players finish:</li>

                <li><strong>Legend</strong> – First player to get rid of all their cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixer</strong> – Second player to shed all their cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Mercenary</strong> – Third player to shed all their cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Street Rat</strong> – The last player holding cards at the end of the round.</li>
                <li>For 5-6 players, roles continue in finishing order beyond the Street Rat.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
